    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Lasagna is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made of very wide, flat sheets. Either term can also refer to an Italian dish made of stacked layers of lasagna alternating with fillings such as ragù, béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses, and seasonings and spices.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>3/4 pound bulk pork sausage</li>
        <li>3 cans (8 ounces each) tomato sauce</li>
        <li>2 cans (6 ounces each) tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1/2 to 1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons minced fresh parsley</li>

        <li>Preheat oven to 375°. Spread 1 cup meat sauce in an ungreased 13x9-in. baking dish. Layer baking dish with 3 noodles, provolone cheese, 2 cups cottage cheese mixture, 1 cup mozzarella, 3 noodles, 2 cups meat sauce, remaining cottage cheese mixture and 1 cup mozzarella. Top with remaining noodles, meat sauce and mozzarella (dish will be full).</li>
